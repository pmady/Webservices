Creating Webservices using Apache CXF framework.

WebServices: Java Web Services are based on Service Oriented Architecture(SOA). SOA is a way to group business capabilities and provide contract
to customers to access them. There by increasing agility and decreasing IT Overhead.

On lighter note webservices are simple service contracts made available over the web.

WebServices are clssified into three groups based on API's they use.They are:JAX-RPC(Java API for XML-based Remote Procedure Call),JAX-WS(Web Services),
JAX-RS(Restful Services).

While creating web services we create by 2 ways:
1)Contract First(Creating first WSDL,XSD later business logic)
2)Contract Last(Creating first business logic,later WSDL and XSD)

In this example I used Contract First.
